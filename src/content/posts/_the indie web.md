Hello, I'm Iko, aka François. I'm a tabletop RPG designer and publisher at [https://www.thelostbaystudio.com/](https://www.thelostbaystudio.com/) and a webdesigner. In this blog I share tips and findings about game design, web design, and print. I'm particularly interested in how those disciplines intertwine and inform each other.
