Real life situations in which procedures are between annoying and crushing

They're a symptom of our society

Often times interactions between individuals and or entities are not freeform but follow procedures, they becole alive in an obscure almost occult way

Instead humans could interact, it's tough, not easy, it's a never ending learning curve, but it's highly rewarding

In games by analogy
- limited set of procedures
- ask the tables

in narratives games, games whose goal is to tell cool story, it's usual to ask the table how the narration should unfold
less so in OSR/NSR non narrative games

it's particularly liberating for the GM, players to invoke the last procedure whenever needed: to build collectively a bit of the world (what's the relationship of that npc with the adventure)
do a complex ruling
modify a rule on the fly
anything else

I used too do it a lot with friends as a kid while playing d&d, refactored rules while the adventure was live

the GM can still arbitrate
