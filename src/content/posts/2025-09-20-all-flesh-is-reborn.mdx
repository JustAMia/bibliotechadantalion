Building resilient communities takes time and sweat. But mostly it requires providing environments that allow the community to blossom, ideas to cross-pollinate, people to meet and share common interests. Just build safe spaces, be welcoming, and let things happen.

That's why, starting October 1st and for a whole month, [The Lost Bay Server](https://discord.com/invite/37XBQVr7eP) hosts the second edition of **All Flesh is Surplus**, The Lost Bay RPG online convention.

At its core: 

- a game jam, [Found Footage of the Bay](https://itch.io/jam/found-footage-of-the-bay)
- gaming sessions and design talks, focused on the REBORN system.

**AFIS** is an event made for and by the members of the community, designers, GMs, players, or simply folks curious to get a taste of The Lost Bay RPG. The convention hasn't formally started yet, but the **Bayers** have already come up with two fantastic ideas:

* **[#all-cofee-is-surplus](https://discord.com/channels/702046991789588480/1417478041382162533)**: a café-like channel to chill, share design tips, jump on impromptu coffee calls, or playtests.
* A collectively designed zine about an abandoned and cursed apartment complex. Last year the community gave birth to the fantastic [BLADES, A COMPENDIUM OF KNIVES](https://www.thelostbaystudio.com/products/blades), and we certainly can expect something as wild this year.

If you're hungry for playing and dice rolls, a series of open game sessions is waiting for you. They feature both official and third-party modules. All games are open to anyone, veteran **Bayers** and first-time players alike, they're run by GMs from TLB community.

Below are all the sessions available. If you'd like to join a game, just click on the RSVP link and add yourself. Joining AFIS sessions is a great way to meet other members of the community, and to try **TLB Reborn** if you haven't yet!

Let's get together and play games.

## Diesel Service Play By Post

Years ago, The Shadow was banished from this world, locked in a celestial prison by The Cat. Now, the devotees of The Shadow, the Hooded Order, have devised a ritual to release their patron, bringing The Shadow back to the Lost Bay and empowering the Hooded Order to strike back at The Cat and their acolytes.

## The Swine

You wake up in bloody broken energy drink coolers, loosely chained closed. Chopping meat from the next room. And you remember the face. The pig mask face of The Swine that took you.

## Festival of Fallen Wings

Every year at the Waterfront, a festival is held to celebrate love and remember those who have passed. This year, a strange wind blows over the bay, bringing a sickness of the mind and heart. Like a moth to the flame, Artists, Actors, and Lovers are drawn to the festival. Then, people begin to go missing. Yet, not all are noticed. Explore and enjoy the festival, search and save those who have gone missing, or discover the Director behind the scenes of the stage.

## Will of The Forest (winterized)

It does not matter if the signs now read “Gareth Pines Park.” It does not matter if the trails are marked with spray-painted blazes. The horrors on this hill are all too real for the people of the Bay, but that does not stop them from flocking to the forest for a much-needed reprieve from the creeping macadam of the suburbs.
