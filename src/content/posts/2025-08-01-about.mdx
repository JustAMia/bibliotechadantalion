Hello, I'm Iko. I'm a tabletop RPG designer and publisher at [thelostbaystudio.com](thelostbaystudio.com) and a web designer. In this blog I discuss game design, building resilient communities, and publishing. I also share updates about our new zines and games. Finally, I occasionally discuss how game and web design might inform each other.
