</figure>

You are so much more than the decaying flesh vessel that serves as your body, and yet that body is your greatest gift. You collect masks, wigs, and clothes, and own the pager number of a controversial **aesthetic** surgeon. You like to dwell in fringe theatres and know the secret entrance to the Old Opera House. The scents of freshly melted latex and face powder fill your lungs with joy. You are one, you are a hundred, free to be anyone, yet sometimes you can’t remember clearly who you are.

You’re a Shifter, and you serve the Mirror.

### **Offering**

* Sculpt your flesh.
* Mimic someone close to you.
* Attach permanent prosthetics to your face.
* Make someone unrecognizable.
* Destroy mirrors.
* Denounce someone innocent.


### **Gifts**

Choose between 0 and 3 gifts. Mark 1 weird per gift. When you reach 6 Weird, you’re dead/lost. Weird might increase during the game.

**Rearrange**. Transform your whole body, face, and voice. Shed your old skin in the process.

**Absorb** a life form and its characteristics into your flesh. Lasts until you use another gift.

**Alter** memories others have of you.

**Transmute**. Transform small objects.

**Blend** into crowds and look like no one, anyone.

**Impersonate** to perfection someone you’ve kissed at least once.

### **Starting Gear**

Roll 1d6

1. Scalpel, antiseptic, needle, and thread
2. Latex, gloves, spray paint
3. Cape, smoke bomb, razor blades
4. Face powder, tranquilizer, script
5. Wig, body paint, colored contact lenses
6. Sculptor. Plaster, chisel, scarf

### **Scars**

**MELTED**. Painful bubbles erupt all over your skin. You’re off-putting and look only partly human. **Are you happy with your new form?**

**DAZED**. Everything blurs, including your memories. You’re not sure who you are anymore, and impersonate a made-up persona until the next scar. **Who are they?**

**MIRRORED**. Your face has changed; you now look like someone else, someone you fear or despise. **What have they done (to you)?**

**SPLIT**. Your evil twin’s face, eye, mouth, or ear grows somewhere on your body. **Where does it sprout, and what does it want from you?**

**FACELESS** Skin overgrows your face. Your voice is muffled and you can barely breathe. Slowly suffocate as the new skin stiffens, unless someone incises it. **Is your body fighting against itself, or trying to tell you something?**

**FICKLE.** Bowels, muscles, and nerves rearrange deep inside your body and lacerate it. You become perfect, the Mirror’s image. **Describe what others see.**

### **The Mirror**

**Form**: Evanescent reflection in a mirror | A gurgling and crawling lump of flesh and hair

**Shrine**: Flesh-corrupted makeup booth

**Clergy**: Retired make-up artist. Barely speaks.

**Omen**: You forget the names of mundane objects.

**Relic**: Barber razor. Use it to sculpt and transform permanently someone’s face.
